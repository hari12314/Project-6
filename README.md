## ðŸš— Car Insurance Claim Prediction â€“ FastAPI + Docker + AWS Deployment
### Project Overview
This project is a machine learning-powered system that predicts whether a customer is likely to make a car insurance claim.
The model is exposed as a REST API built with FastAPI, containerized using Docker, and deployed on AWS EC2 for real-time, scalable access.

### Problem Statement
Insurance companies face challenges in identifying high-risk policyholders and minimizing fraudulent claims.
This system provides a data-driven solution by predicting claim probabilities using customer and policy data - helping insurers make faster, more accurate decisions.

### Objectives
- Automate insurance claim prediction using ML models.
- Deploy the model as a scalable and accessible REST API.
- Enable businesses to integrate predictive insights into their existing workflows.
