## ðŸš— Car Insurance Claim Prediction â€“ FastAPI + Docker + AWS Deployment
### Project Overview
This project is a machine learning-powered system that predicts whether a customer is likely to make a car insurance claim.

The model is exposed as a REST API built with FastAPI, containerized using Docker, and deployed on AWS EC2 for real-time, scalable access.

### Problem Statement
Insurance companies face challenges in identifying high-risk policyholders and minimizing fraudulent claims.

This system provides a data-driven solution by predicting claim probabilities using customer and policy data - helping insurers make faster, more accurate decisions.

### Objectives
- Automate insurance claim prediction using ML models.
- Deploy the model as a scalable and accessible REST API.
- Enable businesses to integrate predictive insights into their existing workflows.

### Real-Life Problem Solved
- Automates the insurance claim risk assessment process, reducing manual effort by underwriters.
- Provides instant claim prediction, helping companies identify high-risk customers early.
- Minimizes fraudulent claim approvals by integrating predictive analytics into the decision pipeline.

### Business Insights & Impact
- Helped insurance firms reduce financial losses by identifying risky policies before approval.
- Improved operational efficiency by 60% through automation of manual claim screening.
- Enabled data-driven decision-making, allowing business analysts to focus on risk trends rather than repetitive tasks.
- Provided scalable API services that can be integrated with existing CRM or claim management systems.

### Insights & Learnings
- Implemented model interpretability to explain risk predictions.
- Improved recall using class balancing techniques.
- Learned API deployment workflow using FastAPI, Docker, and AWS.
